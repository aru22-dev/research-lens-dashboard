# 📊 Research Analytics Dashboard

🚀 **An interactive, dashboard providing insights into the research and innovation landscape through grant funding, academic publications, and patents.**  

## 📌 Overview
This project presents a comprehensive **Tableau dashboard** that visualizes research funding trends, institutional performance, and demographic insights related to NIH/NSF grants, patents, and academic publications. The dashboard empowers policymakers, academic institutions, and funding agencies with actionable data for informed decision-making.

## 🎯 Key Features
✅ Grant distribution across institutions & career stages  
✅ Institutional & geographic research trends  
✅ Diversity analysis (gender & ethnicity) of researchers  
✅ Patent filing patterns & innovation metrics  
✅ Interactive filters for deep exploration 

## 📌 Data Sources
The dashboard is built using the **Author-ity 2009 dataset**, which integrates multiple data sources:
- 📄 **NIH/NSF Grant, Patent & Publication Data:** [Dataset Link](https://databank.illinois.edu/datasets/IDB-4370459)  
- 📄 **Ethnic & Gender Predictions:** [Dataset Link](https://databank.illinois.edu/datasets/IDB-9087546)   

## 📊 Key Insights
The project includes **five dashboards** that provide different analytical perspectives:

### 1️⃣ **Grant Funding & Institutional Performance**
   - 📌 Institutions ranked by number of grants awarded.
